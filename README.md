# OOPS with Java üöÄ

This repository documents my journey of learning **Object-Oriented Programming with Java**.  
Each folder represents a stage of growth ‚Äî from the basics of Java syntax to deeper OOP principles like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.  

Rather than treating these as lab exercises, I see them as milestones that reflect my progress, experiments, and problem-solving approach while exploring Java.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **LAB_1_Introduction to IntelliJ IDEA and Java Programming Basics**  
  My very first programs in Java, where I explored the IntelliJ IDEA setup, and practiced fundamental Java syntax.  
  Each `.java` file contains its own `main()` method, making them independent and runnable individually.  

- **LAB_2_... (coming soon)**  
  Next steps in Java syntax covering control flow statements.  

- **LAB_3_... (planned)**  
  Diving into Classes and Objects.  

More labs will be added gradually as my journey continues.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Programs

1. Navigate to the specific lab folder (e.g., `LAB_1_Introduction to IntelliJ IDEA and Java Programming Basics/src`).
2. Open a terminal inside the `src` folder.
3. Compile the file you want to run:
   ```bash
   javac Question1.java


4. Run the program:
 ```bash
    java Question1
```

(Replace Question1 with the file/class you want to execute.)
 
Each .java file is self-contained with its own main() method.
